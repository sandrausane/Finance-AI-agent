Finance-AI-agent
AI Agent for Automated Financial Report Analysis

This project develops an AI-powered agent capable of analysing annual financial reports, extracting key figures, computing standard financial ratios, and generating peer-review style insights.  
The system supports Latvian company reports and handles financial data in PDFs providing multilingual output.

The agent combines:
- LLM-based extraction (OpenAI GPT-4o, Groq Llama-3, Gemini Pro)  
- Structured parsing using a Pydantic schema  
- Python-based financial ratio calculations (liquidity, profitability, solvency)  
- Plotly visualisations for cross-company comparison  
- A Gradio UI for uploading PDFs and receiving analysis  

This repository contains the full project portfolio, including code, data, methodology artefacts, meeting minutes, presentations, and results.
